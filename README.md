# Top Score (分高下)

## Privacy Policy

Last Updated: November 23, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how Top Score (“we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use our iOS app and its optional cloud features, and describes your choices.

Cloud sync and sharing are optional and disabled by default.

## Summary

- By default, we do not collect or store your personal data.
- If you enable optional cloud sync and sharing, limited game data is stored in Google Firebase to provide those features.
- Data you sync is automatically deleted after 30 days of inactivity.
- Sharing is private: only people with your QR code can view the shared data.
- You can turn cloud sync off at any time.

## What We Collect

By default (cloud sync OFF):
- We do not collect, store, or transmit your personal data.
- Your game data remains on your device.

When you enable cloud sync and sharing (cloud sync ON):
- Game data: game name(s), player nicknames, and scores.
- Identifier: a random UUID generated on your device to identify your app instance for syncing.
- Technical/security data: limited metadata required by Firebase services (e.g., app instance IDs, timestamps, verification data for Firebase App Check).

We do not collect email addresses, phone numbers, or precise location. Player nicknames are user-provided and may identify you if you choose to use your real name.

## How We Use Information

- Provide cloud sync across your devices.
- Enable private sharing with friends via QR code.
- Operate backend logic using Firebase Realtime Database and Firebase Functions.
- Protect service integrity using Firebase App Check.
- Maintain and improve reliability and security.

We do not use your data for advertising or marketing.

## Sharing of Information

- Service Provider: When cloud sync is enabled, your synced data is processed and stored by Google Firebase (Google LLC and its affiliates) on our behalf.
- Friends you share with: People who have your QR code can access the corresponding game data. Data is not public or searchable.
- Legal: We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights, users, or the service.

We do not sell your personal information.

## Data Retention and Your Choices

- Local-only users: We do not collect your data.
- Cloud sync users:
  - Auto-deletion: Synced data (including game names, player nicknames, scores, and related identifiers) is automatically deleted after 30 days of inactivity. Inactivity means no updates to that data for 30 consecutive days.
  - Ongoing use: Each time you update your synced data, the 30‑day period resets.
- Turning off sync: You can disable cloud sync at any time. Disabling sync stops future updates to the cloud; previously synced data will still follow the 30‑day auto‑deletion rule.
- QR codes: If you share a QR code, recipients may access the data until it expires under the auto‑deletion schedule.

We do not currently offer manual deletion requests because data is automatically removed on the schedule above.

## Children’s Privacy

This app is suitable for all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children beyond the limited data described above when cloud sync is enabled (e.g., player nicknames and scores). Please avoid including real names or personal details in nicknames.

## Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your information, including:
- Firebase App Check in production to verify legitimate app instances.
- Transport encryption (HTTPS) for data in transit.
- Access controls and security rules for Firebase Realtime Database and Functions.

No method of transmission or storage is completely secure.

## International Transfers and Storage Location

If you enable cloud sync, your information may be processed and stored by Google Firebase on servers located in the United States. We have configured Firebase to use the us-central1 region for storage and processing where applicable. Depending on service operation, data may be routed or backed up in other locations by Google; where required, we rely on appropriate safeguards for international transfers (e.g., standard contractual clauses).

## Third-Party Services We Use

To provide optional cloud features, we use:
- Firebase Core
- Firebase Realtime Database
- Firebase Functions
- Firebase App Check

For more details, see Google’s Privacy Policy and Firebase’s Privacy and Security documentation.

## Your Rights by Region

The availability of certain privacy rights depends on your location. Regardless of location, you can always:
- Keep cloud sync off to prevent any data from being uploaded.
- Turn cloud sync off at any time.
- Rely on our 30‑day auto‑deletion for cloud data.
